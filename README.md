# Data-Munging using Pandas
Data Munging Titanic dataset
Data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics.
Data munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use.
Data wrangling, sometimes referred to as data munging
Use pandas to clean, reshape, massage and give us a clean data set, all of this will help dramatically increase the quality of our data.


Data exploration — columns, unique values in a column, describe, duplicates
Dealing with missing values — quantifying missing values per column, filling & dropping missing values
Filtering data
Sorting
Merge & concatenation



Datasets can be processed and cleaned using Pandas library and we can perform various techniques to clean it up.
